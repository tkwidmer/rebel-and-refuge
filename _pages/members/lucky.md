### Bio

International Mr.Bootblack, 2018, Lucky Rebel,  is originally from San Diego, California. Growing up in a motorcycle family, he developed an interest in leather early. He currently lives in Portland, Oregon where he served as  Mr. Oregon State Leather, 2016. When he's not actively working on dismantling white supremacy, tearing down the patriarchy, and smashing the status quo, you can find him hustling his handmade leather care products, "Rebel Rubs and Suds." He is proud to be an Onyx Northwest Brother and uses his influence to promote the concept that "Representation Matters."
