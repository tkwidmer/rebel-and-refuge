# Trans 101: Basic Trans Competency for the Leather Community

Trans people exist and are an important part of both the LGBT and the leather community. In this class, we’ll talk about the basics in regards to trans competency. We’ll define some shared vocabulary, talk about pronouns, and talk about what it’s like to be transgender in the leather community. We’ll also try to brainstorm about what our own specific communities and events can do to make ourselves more inclusive to trans people.
