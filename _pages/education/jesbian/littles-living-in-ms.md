### Littles living in an M/s world

##### Co-Presenter: slave brynn, International slave 2019

In a world where we believe we can do anything, we take on the little as the slave submissive in a power exchange world. Littles are an identity that is regression or age role play and can fit into many boxes. We will discuss common myths of littles as brats as well as the positive that a little brings to the dynamic. Bring an open mind and questions at the ready!
