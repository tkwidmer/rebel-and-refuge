### Fuck my Shit up, Please?

Being direct and very blunt seems to be a mystifying art form. But it can be very useful in the scene and help navigate social merry-go-rounds. This includes but it not limited to how to say and hear the words “No”. It's going to happen, rejection is apart of life. This class is all about advocating for your needs with positive and direct negotiation. It will consist of full participation exercises on how to ask directly for your needs and hear the words yes and no gracefully. Because if you don't ask you will never know. And if you don't listen you won't learn.
