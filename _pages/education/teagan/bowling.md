### Bowling With Bumpers: Rules and Protocols to help your littles grow.

So many classes talk about how to correct behavior or punish littles, but in this class we are going to focus on how Bigs can set your Littles up for success, not for failure. What I’ve found during the past three years in my authority transfer relationship with a Little, is that largely: she just wants to be good. In this class we won’t focus on punishment or on owning a ‘brat.’ Instead we will explore how a Big/little relationship can include authority transfer in ways that add to and strengthen the relationship. We will talk about clear communication, expectation setting, adapting on the fly, and ultimately providing safety for your Little to grow. If your ageplay dynamic also includes authority transfer, this is the class for you!
