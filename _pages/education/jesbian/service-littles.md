### Service Littles: Service in Many Forms

This class will explore the concept of Age Play as a Power Exchange with the role of the Dominant expressed as a Big and the role of the submissive expressed as a little. We will dig deeper into "the service little" defining multiple paths of service. This includes ways to not only give back to Bigs but also to the leather community at large. We adapt our class to all age players no matter their age and explore the concepts of how to be a "service little" with a can-do attitude. There will be a work exercise to begin identifying  unique service skills and how to customize your service bag.
