    <h2>Rebel Rubs</h2>
    <p>
      Hand made in small batches in Portland Oregon, Rebel Rubs is an all organic and all natural leather conditioner. Made from a bee's wax base, it contains shelf stable coconut oil. It's safe to use on lightly colored leathers like white and tan and it will not darken the leather. It's safe to use on softer leathers like garments and boots that do not take a shine. It protects against mold and mildew and helps to waterproof leather. To use, simply apply a small portion with your hands and massage into the leather.
    </p>

    <p>
      Allergy Notification: Contains Coconut.

        <p>"No Bootblack kit is really complete without Rebel Rubs. It will condition the oldest pair of boots that sits in your stand with the same ease it conditions any exotics you’ll see. Being colorless it preserves fantastic colors in your leathers and stitches, even leaving your whites perfectly white with no yellowing over time."</p>

        <p>"Within moments of having my corset done using Lucky Suds, I was tracking him down to buy my own jar. It left the leather feeling more soft and supple than I had managed to get using other products. A year and a half later both Suds and Rubs are my go to products now. The most important part for me, being a person who is rather scent sensitive, is neither product is overly fragrant. You are left with clean, soft leather that doesn’t smell like chemicals. All the stars go to Lucky for his Suds and Rubs."</p>
