<h1 class="mt-5"> San Francisco Eagle Bootblack Schedule </h1>

The world famous San Francisco Eagle is one of the best oportunities to bootblack in the bay area. There are four shifts availible to book every weekend. The Beer Bust is always a popular attraction and will provide you with one of the busiest shifts you've probably ever worked. 

<h3> Booking A Shift </h3>

To book a shift, click on the button below. It should show you appointment slots that are availible in the coming weeks. A bootblack shift at the eagle is 3 hours. 

<h3> Ground Rules: </h3>
- You can book a shift up to 90 days in advance
- You must book each shift individually. There is no way to book "every saturday night" for example. 
- When you book yourself for a shift, your email address will be displayed publicly via the schedule below.
- Please input the scene name we know you by. 
- Try to be considerate of other bootblacks in the area and only book shifts you can commit to.
- If you cannot work a shift, cancel your shift ahead of time so that other bootblacks might pick it up.
- Do not cancel other people's shifts.
- Email imsbb2018 @ imslbb [dot] org if you have any issues
