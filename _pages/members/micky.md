### Bio

Micky Rebel is equally at home under a boot being stomped, as she is under a boot in the stand. As Oregon State Bootblack 2015, she enjoyed teaching what she loves, from boot worship to cigar play. She shines with her whole leather heart and all the service her longtime Sir instilled in her during their 7 years in a 24/7 D/s. This Queer, Poly, Pony, little, has diverse interests and likes to flag red and purple, on the right. She volunteers as a board member for Portland Pets and Handlers, Blackout Leather Productions and Portland Girls of Leather. She is a Bad Girl and PDX Bootblack, co-founder of PDX BootLab.
