### Polish by Numbers: A Littles Perspective on Bootblacking

Ever look at a bootblack kit and be super overwhelmed? Ever see a bootblack rub, mix, and buff a boot to shine in under 10 minutes and not know what just happened?? Cool! Me Too! In this class I will break down this bootlicking mystery into a polish by numbers step by step guide to bootblacking. We will also embrace the artsy side of bootblacking with some creme color mixing and enjoy the messy side of grease rubbing fun! In this class, you can do no wrong and have some fun in this bootblack laboratory! So bring your kits, bring your leathers, and lets get messy! Plastic ponchos and or drops cloths are highly recommended!
