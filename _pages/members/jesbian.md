### Bio

Jesbian Bagheera is a leather femme dandy. She gets down and dirty at the SF Eagle bootblack stand as a switchy ashtray. When she is not up to her knees in shenanigans and sass, she is volunteering with The SF Little Scouts and SF girls of Leather. She has been licking leathers and force feeding cupcakes in the community since 2011. She previously held the title International Little Miss Little 2014. She was also Ms California Leather 2017. She continues to advocate for Leather Littles everywhere while continuing to build her education directory V.I.V.I.D. Leather for POC visibility.
