The Baseline is a class geared to help you figure out your minimum needs, qualities, and expectations in potential partners. It is your jumping off point for kinky relationships before negotiating in the murky waters of kink. Knowing your baseline will help you navigate your way to positives experiences. It also promotes self advocacy, knowing your boundaries, and how to clearly define what you want to consent to. Come explore yourself in the discussion of what we want and how to shape that frame. In this class be prepared to discuss: your needs in dynamics and relationships, vetting a potential human, accountability through protocol, consent, and closure agreements.
