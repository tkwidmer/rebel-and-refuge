### Bio

Teagan fell in love with bootblacking at a young age, doing her shoes before church. Although these days her skills are being put to more salacious uses, she still identifies as a spiritual bootblack. For her, bootblacking harkens back to the foot-washing ritual. Teagan is International Ms Bootblack 2018, and the 20th person to hold that title. She is based in Oakland, CA. During her title year she invited our community to "Take Refuge" in the capable hands of our bootblacks. She's the owner and executive producer of the San Francisco Bootblack Contest.

### Presenting

Equipped with a MFA in theatre education, Teagan has brought her skills in the classroom
to the leather community. She can be found presenting around the world about Bootblacking,
D/s relationships, and how to make your play hotter.
