### Playing With My Food

This class is an exploration of tasting... and touching your food. I showcase the smallest licks to the biggest sploshing with no holds bared demos. From your basics of cream and sugar to elaborate cupcakes and pies to the savory bloody temptations of meats on a hook hook... this class is made to inspire your most delectable desires. Bottom Line: Itâ€™s Playing with your food for Adults. Tap into the mess you were never allowed to have.
