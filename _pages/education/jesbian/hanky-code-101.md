In this class we will be decoding the hanky code to make sure you are in the know the next time a cute human is flagging what youâ€™re interested in. We will go over a brief history of how the code got started, why it is still relevant today, and discuss some of the myths and misconceptions of flagging. Come with your notebooks and put some knowledge in your flirting toolkit.
